## 3. Gap Analysis

| # | Gap | Severity | Fix |
|---|-----|----------|-----|
| 1 | Missing `frontend/` directory | 🔴 | Scaffold Next.js 14+ frontend with shadcn/ui |
| 2 | Missing `backend/` directory | 🔴 | Scaffold FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy 2.0 |
| 3 | Missing `docs/` directory | 🟡 | Create docs/ with getting-started, guides, reference, releases |
| 4 | Missing `helm/` directory | 🟡 | Copy helm chart from dclaw-scaffold and customize |
| 5 | Missing test suite | 🟡 | Add pytest + pytest-asyncio tests in backend/tests/ |
| 6 | Missing Alembic migrations | 🟡 | Initialize alembic and create initial migration |
| 7 | Missing `dclaw-manifest.json` | 🔴 | Create frontend/public/dclaw-manifest.json for DPanel |
| 8 | Minimal source code — mostly template scaffold | 🔴 | Implement P0 backend models, API routes, and frontend pages |

## 4. Sacred Architecture & Tech Stack

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every DClaw product MUST use this exact stack.**

| Layer | Technology | Version |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14+ | App Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| **Backend** | FastAPI | Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.0, asyncpg |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 | CloudNativePG operator in K8s |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant / pgvector | Only if RAG / semantic search |
| **Cache / Bus** | Redis | 7.x |
| **Object Storage** | MinIO | Latest |
| **Workflow** | Temporal.io | Only if automation/orchestration |
| **Auth** | Logto | JWT validation on all protected routes |
| **Billing** | Stripe | Metered or per-seat |
| **K8s Operator** | Go + controller-runtime | 0.18 |
| **LLM Local** | Ollama | Apple Silicon |
| **LLM Cloud** | OpenRouter + Kimi K2.5 | Fallback |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana | Latest |

### 4.1 Python Rules
- `ruff` formatting enforced
- Type hints on ALL public APIs
- `pydantic` v2 for schemas
- `sqlalchemy` 2.0 style (`Mapped`, `mapped_column`)
- `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio` for tests
- Functions < 50 lines
- No `print()` — use `structlog`

### 4.2 TypeScript / Next.js Rules
- Strict TypeScript (`strict: true`)
- Tailwind for ALL styling
- `cn()` utility for conditional classes
- No `any` without `// @ts-ignore`

### 4.3 Docker Standards
- Port mappings MUST match container listen port
- Healthchecks MUST use binaries present in base image
- `docker compose config` must pass before shipping
- Service type MUST be `ClusterIP`
- TLS required on all ingress

## 9. AI Copilot Mandate (YC S25/W26 Requirement)

Every DClaw app MUST have an AI Copilot as its first P0 feature. The copilot must:
1. Be contextually aware of the app's domain data
2. Use RAG over the app's knowledge base where applicable
3. Suggest next actions, not just answer questions
4. Be accessible from every page via floating chat or sidebar
5. Fall back to local Ollama when cloud is unavailable

---

## 10. Next Tasks for Vibe Coders

1. **Scaffold the backend**: Create `backend/app/` with models, schemas, API routes, and services per the P0 features above.
2. **Scaffold the frontend**: Create `frontend/src/app/` with pages for each P0 feature using Next.js 14 App Router + shadcn/ui.
3. **Add infrastructure**: Create `helm/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, and `docs/` following dclaw-scaffold conventions.
4. **Write tests**: Add `backend/tests/` with pytest + pytest-asyncio covering all P0 API endpoints.

## 11. Domain Research Notes

Inspired by Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Wrike. AI project management prevents 70% of project failures.
